# SinusBot Installer Script

Hello! I want to present you the new mini update that I did to the installer script for SinusBot made by Philipp Esswein.

The update in question is for Ubuntu 22.04, although I didn't test it for 18.04, because I had to disable the "TimeSync" part because the plugin or implementation showed us an error. In addition to the part where you install all the dependencies you need, change the "python" package to "python-is-python3". In addition to the fact that we are not going to have an error with the new yt-dlp updated a few months ago, which is working perfectly. If you have any errors, please, I ask you to report it. Since I will be maintaining it, if I have time.

### Installation 🔧

1. Enter the terminal of your VPS.

2. Run this command through your terminal:

   ```
   bash <(wget -O - 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prinzssj/sinusbot_installer/main/sinusbot_installer.sh')
   ```

3. Next, carefully read the options that the script gives you, and continue the installation on your own.
